Wield the power of Thor's hammer to smite down the moles. Press the corresponding key on your keyboard to whack them, but be careful to not press the wrong button!  Also, if a mole goes back down without you hitting it, you will lose a heart. Lose all your hearts and it's game over.

Note: Only works on QWERTY keyboards.
